# ðŸ“Š Stock Analysis Web Application

An interactive web app built with Streamlit to visualize historical stock data (closing prices and trading volume) of leading tech stocks using the yfinance API. Users can dynamically select a stock, time period, and data interval to explore price trends over time. This project demonstrates practical knowledge of interactive data visualization, API-based data retrieval, UI/UX design using Streamlit, and deployment of Python applications to the cloud. It provides a robust foundation for building financial analytics dashboards and showcases effective use of modern Python tools in real-world projects.
